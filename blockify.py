"""
`blockify.py` is a Python library that decomposes an image into rectangular blocks
of solid color. Its intended use is to compute very lightweight SVG approximations
to an input image that can be displayed while the image is loading.

Inspired by https://github.com/fogleman/primitive, but `blockify.py` chooses a
tradeoff weighted more heavily on "output sparsity" than "fidelity to the original image."
